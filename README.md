## Regression Model for predicting house Values in California
This project uses the California Housing Prices dataset to build and evaluate  regression models for predicting house values.
Through data visualization, preprocessing, and model comparison, the goal is to identify the most suitable regression model for accurately estimating house prices in California.

**Key Objectives:**
1. **Data VIsualization**
   - Visualize key features of the dataset to gain insights into the distribution and relationships of variables.
   - Identify potential correlations and patterns that may inform feature selection and modeling decisions.
3. **Data Preproccess**
   - Handling entries with null values
   - Extracting new features 
5. **Model Comparison**
   - Creating and evaluating Linear Regression Model
   - Creating and evaluating  Random Forest Regressor
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV  for our Random Forest Regressor
